##Purple Hinged Rock Scallops (*Crassadomea gigantea*)

```{r pressure, echo=F,out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/maya/Desktop/scallop.jpg")
```

- species range from Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska
- filter feeders, up to 25 year life-span
- vulnerable to overfishing
- No current aquaculture production

##Research Question

1. Does adductor diameter change as the scallop gonad matures?
2. What factors influnce adductor diameter and gonad maturation stage?

##Methods

Collected data from our three grow out sites (Neah Bay, Dabob Bay, and Totten Inlet)

```{r, include=FALSE}
scallop_df <- read.csv("Rdataformat_03132018.csv") %>% 
  filter(Location, sex, mc_1_mode, T2_adductor) %>% 
  setnames(old=c("T2_adductor","mc_1_mode", "sex"), new=c("Adductor Diameter (mm)", "Maturation Stage", "Sex"))
knitr::kable(scallop_df)
```

Gonad tissue samples were collected and histology slides were prepared to rate maturation stages of each individual scallop. 

24 acini were rated for each individual and the mode across all 24 acini determined overall maturation stage for the organism.
