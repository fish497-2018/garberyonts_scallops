# Data/Question

#### This is observational data of ~400 rock scallops that have been grown out in three different regions of Puget Sound and the outer coast.
#### Maturation stages were collected via histological analysis and external metrics were recorded
#### The broad question here is what factors influence adductor diameter and what metrics are significant predictors of adductor diameter?

# Broad Plan for Data Analysis

#### Linear Model including measured factors
#### Plot external metric vs. adductor diameter

#### Data construction - delineate between sites.
